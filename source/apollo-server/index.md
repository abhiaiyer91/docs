description: How to install the Apollo GraphQL server tools.
---

Apollo Server is an npm package and an opinionated guide for how to build a GraphQL server in JavaScript.


```txt
npm install apollo-server
```

Apollo Server bundles a set of functions from the `graphql-tools` package, which are not just useful for building servers, but can also be used in the browser, for example to mock a backend during development or testing. Even though our guide recommends a specific way of building GraphQL servers, you can use these tools even if you don't follow our guide; they work with any GraphQL-JS schema, and each tool can be useful on its own.
